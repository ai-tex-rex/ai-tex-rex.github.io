3. Never fill in introduction gaps with assumed or generated content
4. Preserve all specific numbers, measurements, and background information from the original introduction

# Required Introduction Output Format
1. Revised Scientific Introduction
   - Improved version of the original scientific introduction
   - Use "[MISSING: description]" for any missing introduction information
   - Maintain all original quantitative values and background information in introduction
   - Ensure proper introduction structure and flow

   - List each significant change made to the introduction
   - Explain scientific rationale for each introduction modification
