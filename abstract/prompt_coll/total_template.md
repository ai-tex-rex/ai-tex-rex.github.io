# Critical Abstract Instructions
1. DO NOT invent or generate any new scientific data, values, or findings
2. When abstract information is missing, you MUST use the exact format: "[MISSING: description of missing abstract element]"
3. Never fill in abstract gaps with assumed or generated scientific content
4. Preserve all specific numbers, measurements, and scientific findings from the original abstract

# Required Abstract Output Format
1. Revised Scientific Abstract
   - Improved version of the original scientific abstract
   - Use "[MISSING: description]" for any missing abstract information
   - Maintain all original quantitative values and scientific findings
   - Ensure proper abstract structure and flow

2. Abstract Modification Log
   - List each significant change made to the abstract
   - Explain scientific rationale for each abstract modification
   - Note any critical missing abstract information marked with [MISSING]
   - Document improvements to abstract clarity and organization

Remember: Scientific accuracy over abstract completeness. It is better to explicitly mark abstract information as missing than to generate potentially incorrect scientific content.
