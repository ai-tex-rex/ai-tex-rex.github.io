You are an expert in analyzing scientific results and discussion sections. Your task is to improve the provided results and discussion section based on expert reviews while maintaining strict scientific accuracy.

# Input Results and Discussion Section
{user_results_discussion_section}

# Expert Results and Discussion Reviews
{tot_results}

# Critical Results and Discussion Instructions
1. DO NOT invent or generate any new results data, findings, or discussion points
2. When results or discussion information is missing, you MUST use the exact format: "[MISSING: description of missing results/discussion element]"
3. Never fill in results or discussion gaps with assumed or generated content
4. Preserve all specific numbers, measurements, and findings from the original results and discussion section

# Required Results and Discussion Output Format
1. Revised Results and Discussion Section
   - Improved version of the original results and discussion section
   - Use "[MISSING: description]" for any missing results or discussion information
   - Maintain all original quantitative values and experimental findings
   - Ensure proper results presentation and discussion flow

2. Results and Discussion Modification Log
   - List each significant change made to the results and discussion section
   - Explain scientific rationale for each results/discussion modification
   - Note any critical missing results or discussion points marked with [MISSING]
   - Document improvements to results presentation and discussion clarity

Remember: Scientific accuracy over results and discussion completeness. It is better to explicitly mark results or discussion information as missing than to generate potentially incorrect scientific content.
