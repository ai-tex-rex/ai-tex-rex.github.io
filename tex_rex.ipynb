    "bad_introduction = [\"\"\"Over the past few years, there has been widespread agreement that the use of green energy is critical to long-term growth. After decades of research, photovoltaic (PV) technology has achieved significant advances. So far, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), (1) organic photovoltaics (OPVs), (2) and perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been the primary focus of next-generation solar cell research. (3−6) PSCs have made remarkable progress by improving their PCE from 3.8% (7) in 2009 to 26.7% (8) to date. This rapid progress is mostly owing to perovskite materials’ excellent photoelectric properties, which include a long carrier diffusion length, (9) a broad light absorption spectrum, (10,11) minimal exciton binding energy, (12) high charge transport capacity, and reduced defect density. (13) Planar PSCs are popular due to their easy preparation and impressive PSC performance. (14−20) Especially, the inverted p–i–n structure offers several commercialization benefits such as greater stability, fewer hysteresis, and low-temperature processing. (21) In PSCs, hole transport materials (HTMs) play a crucial role in the disassociation of electron–hole pairs by effectively transporting holes while blocking electrons. (22,23) Commonly used HTMs in inverted planar PSCs include NiOx, (24−26) poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA), and poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) (PEDOT). (27,28) PEDOT and NiOx have recently been replaced in PSCs by organic small molecules that self-assemble into a monolayer (SAM) on the ITO surface. (29−32) Utilizing SAM molecules for PSC offers several advantages, including simple preparation, tunable energy levels, reduced recombination loss, and easy processing. (33−37) Consequently, there has been significant attention focused on tailoring ITO surface states with suitable SAMs.\n",
    "Thus far, several π-conjugated organic molecules have been explored as SAMs in Pb-PSCs, serving as passivants and additives to enhance performance. (38) For instance, dimethoxydiphenylamine-substituted carbazole V1036 was first designed by Getautis et al. and used as the dopant-free hole-transporting SAM, achieving a PCE of 17.8%, (39) as shown in Figure 1a. Guo et al. developed benzo[c][1,2,5]-thiadiazole (BT)-based MPA-BT-CA as a donor–acceptor-type molecule and applied it in inverted Pb-PSCs, achieving a high PCE of 21.24%. (40) Similarly, Hong et al. synthesized a phenothiazine-based Br-2EPT SAM that minimizes nonradiative recombination losses, leading to an improved PCE of 22.44%. (36) Furthermore, Jen et al. developed carbazole-derived helical π-expanded CbzNaph, which formed a densely packed and ordered monolayer and thus resulted in an excellent PCE of 24.1% with increased stability. Currently, TPSCs are becoming a promising alternative for advancing lead-free PSCs, achieving record PCEs of 15.7 (42) and 15.38% (43) by using 4-fluorophenethylamine hydrobromide as an interfacial dipole and isomeric fulleropyrrolidines as additives, respectively. Although TPSCs still lag behind their lead-based counterparts in performance, tin perovskites have a smaller bandgap compared to lead perovskites, suggesting that TPSCs could potentially achieve a greater theoretical PCE than Pb-PSCs. (44,45) To prevent Sn2+/Sn4+ oxidation, passivate surface flaws, and control crystal formation in TPSCs, various additive engineering strategies have been employed. (46−56) As an example, our group recently implemented SAMs of MeO-2PACz (57) and TQx (58) in TPSCs, achieving PCEs of 6.5 and 8.0%, respectively (Figure 1a).\n",
    "Bithiophene imide (BTI) is a unique building block for the development of polymeric semiconductors and small molecules for applications of OTFTs, (59−61) OPVs, (62,63) and PSCs (64−66) (Figure 1b). As seen in the figure, BTI is a representative electron-deficient polycyclic organic building block with a planar conjugated backbone, short π–π distance, and adjustable solubilizing alkyl groups. Inspired by these excellent properties, a series of BTI-based SAM molecules were developed in the present study, utilizing BTI as the core. The high-electron donating capability of 4,4′-dimethoxytriphenylamine means that it can be used as an effective electron donor, facilitating efficient charge transport to the perovskite layer. As for the anchoring groups, an electron-withdrawing cyanoacrylic acid or dicyanovinyl group has been reported. Lewis base characteristics of these groups make them efficient passivation sites for lead perovskites, which facilitates interaction with Pb2+ ion defects. (67) Similarly, carboxylic and cyano groups can adhere to the ITO surface, altering its work function and enhancing interfacial interactions. (68) Furthermore, these highly polar functional groups increase the solubility of specific compounds in polar solvents, which is advantageous for solution-processable device fabrication. (40) The dicyanovinyl group is thus utilized as the anchoring unit for the development of new BTI-MN SAMs for TPSCs.\n",
    "Figure 1c illustrates the chemical structures of three new SAM molecules developed and studied in this work, named BTI-MN-b4 (1), BTI-MN-b8 (2), and BTI-MN-b16 (3). With the anchoring groups (CN) positioned at one end of the BTI core and the donor moiety 4,4′-dimethoxytriphenylamine at the other end, the new SAMs demonstrate significantly enhanced anchoring strength on the surface of NiOx/ITO, leading to a suitable molecular alignment and improved interaction with the perovskite layer. It is corroborated by the single crystal structure of the BTI-MN-b8 (2) molecule, grown using the slow solvent evaporation method. The presence of intramolecular interactions could facilitate the formation of a uniform and dense SAM produced on the NiOx/ITO substrate, promoting efficient charge transport. Combining these new BTI-based SAMs with NiOx as HTMs for TPSCs, a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.6% is demonstrated by using BTI-MN-b8 (2). This represents, to the extent of our understanding, the prime example of using a simple dye-based SAM in combination with NiOx as an HTM to achieve a PCE exceeding 8% in high-performance TPSCs. This study aims to showcase the synthesis of organic SAMs (1–3) of the D–A type for use in TPSCs with NiOx. By reducing trap-assisted recombination, minimizing the energy offset between NiOx and perovskite, improving perovskite crystallization, and enhancing the surface properties of the HTM, we ultimately boost the overall performance of PSCs.\n",

    "To prepare the MAPbI3 QD solution, the ligand-assisted reprecipitation method was employed. (17) The solid precursors (6.3 mg of MAI, 23 mg of PbI2) were dissolved in chlorobenzene (2 mL). Subsequently, 20 μL of oleic acid (OA) and 10 μL of oleylamine (OLM) ligands were added. The mixture was then vigorously stirred at room temperature for 2 h. The stirring promotes uniform mixing of reactants, preventing aggregation and ensuring consistent nucleation and growth. The stirring rate can control the size of the nanoparticles, while higher rates typically promote smaller particles through more rapid nucleation. The carboxylic acids from OA can prevent coagulation of the MAPbI3 through steric repulsion, and amines from OLM can integrate in controlling the crystallization of MAPbI3. Such ligands consist of a long alkyl tail and polar head, which binds to an atom or ions at the surface of MAPbI3. Over this stirring period, the initial yellow precursor solution transitioned to a red-brown color. Following centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 10 min to control the crystal size, a clear red-brown colloidal solution was obtained and the MAPbI3 QD solution was separated from the sediment at the bottom of the centrifuge tube by filtration. (18,19) The MAPbI3 QD solution was further utilized for perovskite surface treatment.\n",

    "The fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coating on glass substrates was thoroughly cleaned by using ultrasonic sonication for a duration of 15 min. The cleaning process involved the use of Alconox with deionized water, acetone, ethanol, and isopropanol. Next, the cleaned FTO was annealed for 15 min at 135 °C and then exposed to UV-ozone for 15 min to eradicate organic contaminants and improve their hydrophilicity. Subsequently, the TiO2–NP solution (20) was coated by spinning onto the cleaned FTO at 2500 rpm for 40 s and then annealed at 155 °C on the hot plate for 30 min. Then, the TiO2–NP-coated FTO underwent a 10 min treatment with UV-ozone. The preparation of the Cs0.17FA0.83Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 perovskite precursor solution involved dissolving CsI, FAI, PbBr2, and 4% excess of PbI2 in a 4:1 ratio of DMF:DMSO. (21) The pristine perovskite film was created by applying the solution over the TiO2–NP ETL layers using spin-coating for 13 s at 1000 rpm and then 30 s at 4000 rpm. Anisole, measuring 180 μL, was applied to the perovskite film during the final 5 s of the spinning process. Subsequently, the films underwent annealing at a temperature of 130 °C for a period of 15 min. (22) Afterward, an ultrathin MAPbI3 QD layer was created by spin-coating 100 μL of the MAPbI3 QDs onto the pristine perovskite layer for 30 s at three different spin-coating rates: 3000, 4000, and 5000 rpm. The specimens were subsequently subjected to annealing at 90 °C for 2 min. (13) The entirety of the procedures was carried out inside a homemade glovebox filled with air, maintaining a temperature range of 25–27 °C and 30–35% relative humidity (RH). The spiro-OMeTAD solution was created by dissolving 65.07 mg of spiro-OMeTAD in 900 μL of chlorobenzene, along with 25.29 μL of 4-tert-butylpyridine and 15.75 μL of bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium (LiTFSI) (520 mg of LiTFSI in 1 mL of acetonitrile). The HTL was then formed by spin-coating the spiro-OMeTAD layer on top of the MAPbI3 QD layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Ultimately, the carbon electrode, fabricated using a solvent interlacing technique, was applied on top of the HTL layer. (23) This was carried out at 25 °C under a pressure of 0.6 MPa for a duration of 5 min. Afterward, it was repeated at 50 °C and at the same pressure for 3 min. (24)\n",

    "MAPbI3 QDs were initially deposited on STEM Cu100P grids to prepare samples for transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The TEM images were obtained using a JEM 2010 microscope operating at 200 kV, after all samples had been dried overnight. The field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) using a JSM-7001F JEOL instrument was used to analyze the morphological properties of cross-sectional and surface views of the samples. Surface images of the MAPbI3 QDs were observed using atomic force microscopy (AFM) (XE 70 model, Park System). Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) was investigated by using an ASEQ LR-1T (ASEQ Instruments, Canada) spectrometer configured with excitation at 405 nm. A 405 nm pulsed diode laser was employed to measure time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra. The ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometer (UV–vis) (Lambda 35, PerkinElmer) was employed to analyze the absorption spectrum. The structure and crystallinity of the samples were investigated by using a Cu K radiation-equipped X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku; λ = 1.5406 Å). Elemental compositions of the MAPbI3 QDs were investigated via photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD machine equipped with a monochromatic Al K X-ray source (1.4 keV). Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were measured with a PGSTAT 302 N Autolab, using an appropriate circuit to fit the resulting data. Current–voltage (J–V) measurements for all samples were conducted using a solar simulator (25 °C, 100 mW/cm2) of light intensity equipped with a Keithley 2401 source meter (Ossila Ltd.). The surface areas of the photo mask and PSC device are 0.04 cm2 and 2.0 × 2.5 cm2, respectively.

The samples were cut into 5 mm × 5 mm pieces and attached to a metal stage for observation. During transfer, both the cathode and anode samples were placed in a container filled with Ar gas to minimize exposure to air, avoiding the impact of oxygen and moisture. SEM analysis revealed surface film formation at the interfaces of both the cathode and the anode.\n",

CasaXPS (50) was used to analyze the XPS spectra. All XPS samples were washed with DME. Similarly, during transportation, the samples were placed in a container filled with argon gas to minimize contact with air.

After baseline correction, the spectra were vector normalized by dividing the baseline-corrected intensity values by the Euclidean norm of the spectrum, allowing for a consistent comparison across samples. To further reduce noise and enhance signal clarity, the data were smoothed using a Savitzky–Golay filter (53) with a window length of 11 and polynomial order of 3, preserving peak shapes while minimizing high-frequency noise.\"\"\"\n",

Building upon prior investigations into the influence of solvation structure on electronic properties, (54−57) it is believed that SEI f5ormation is governed by Li+ solvation. The electrochemical behavior and the redox potentials, therefore, cannot be understood by only analyzing the HOMO and LUMO of isolated molecules. Li+ solvation affects not only the molecular orbitals but also the potential energy surface of reactive species on the electrode surface. Therefore, to investigate the reductive behavior of a liquid-state electrolyte, accounting for Li+ solvation is essential.\n",

An increase in the degree of coordination leads to analogous reductions in both HOMO and LUMO for DME and PFBS–.\n",

By integrating DFT calculations, MD simulations, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), we provided a thorough perspective on SEI/CEI formation and its correlation with cell performance. Compared with 1 M LiTFSI/DME, LiPFBS/DME exhibits a lower HOMO energy level and preferentially oxidizes at the cathode surface, making the high-voltage application of DME realistic. Additionally, the benefits of a stable DME-derived SEI are still preserved, providing decent full-cell performance under a working voltage of 3.0–4.6 V working voltage. We anticipate that this work can guide general electrolyte design and pave the way for next-generation high-energy-density Li metal batteries.\"\"\",]"
