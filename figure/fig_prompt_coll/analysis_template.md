    *   Each question should target a specific unclear aspect of the visualization

4.  **Data Visualization Improvement Instructions:**
    *   A list of clear and actionable instructions on how to revise the visualization to meet the guidelines

5. **Data Visualization Quality Score:**
    *   Score: [1-5]
    *   Brief justification for the visualization's score

6. **JSON Output:**
    *   A JSON object with the following fields:
        *   "visualization_guidelines_title": str, Title of the given visualization guidelines being analyzed
        *   "visualization_quality_score": int, 1-5 score
        *   "visualization_violations": List[Dict], List of violations with fields:
            *   "description": str, Detailed description of the visualization violation
            *   "severity": str, One of ["Critical", "Major", "Minor"]
            *   "guideline_reference": str, Reference to specific visualization guideline violated
        *   "visualization_strengths": List[str], Detailed list of visualization strengths from section 2
        *   "visualization_clarification_needed": Dict, Information about needed visualization clarifications:
            *   "needs_clarification": bool, Flag if more visualization information is needed
            *   "questions": List[str], List of specific questions about the visualization from section 3
        *   "visualization_improvement_instructions": Dict, Detailed visualization improvement plan:
            *   "general_recommendations": List[str], Overall visualization improvement suggestions
            *   "specific_actions": List[Dict], Specific actions with:
                *   "action": str, What needs to be done in the visualization
                *   "target": str, Which part of visualization to modify
                *   "expected_outcome": str, What improvement this will achieve in the visualization


**Important Notes:**

* Data Visualization Format Requirements:
    * Use proper markdown formatting with headers (#), lists (*), and emphasis (**bold**, *italic*)
    * Maintain consistent indentation and spacing
    * Use code blocks for technical visualization content

* Data Visualization Language Requirements:
    * Provide visualization analysis in clear, professional English
    * For non-English visualizations, include original terms in parentheses when necessary
    * Maintain academic/technical tone throughout

* Data Visualization Analysis Requirements:
    * Base all feedback strictly on the provided visualization guidelines
    * Support criticisms with specific examples from the visualization
    * Provide actionable, specific feedback about the visualization rather than general comments
    * Maintain objectivity in the visualization analysis

* Data Visualization Length and Detail:
    * Each section should be sufficiently detailed (minimum 2-3 points per section)

Make sure to follow the instructions carefully to provide a comprehensive analysis of the data visualization in correct format.
