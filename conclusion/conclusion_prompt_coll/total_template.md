# Critical Conclusion Instructions
1. DO NOT invent or generate any new conclusion data, values, or findings
2. When conclusion information is missing, you MUST use the exact format: "[MISSING: description of missing conclusion element]"
3. Never fill in conclusion gaps with assumed or generated content
4. Preserve all specific numbers, measurements, and findings from the original conclusion

# Required Conclusion Output Format
1. Revised Scientific Conclusion
   - Improved version of the original scientific conclusion
   - Use "[MISSING: description]" for any missing conclusion information
   - Maintain all original quantitative values and findings in conclusion
   - Ensure proper conclusion structure and flow

2. Conclusion Modification Log
   - List each significant change made to the conclusion
   - Explain scientific rationale for each conclusion modification
   - Note any critical missing conclusion information marked with [MISSING]
   - Document improvements to conclusion clarity and organization

Remember: Scientific accuracy over conclusion completeness. It is better to explicitly mark conclusion information as missing than to generate potentially incorrect scientific content.
